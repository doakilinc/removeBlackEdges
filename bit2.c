 *     About: This file is used to create a bit vector struct where a client 
 *     can store data in a 2D bit vector. It also has functions that helps the
 *     client to get the width, height, and element size information about the 
 *     vector, traverse the vector in row major and column major order, access
 *     to an element at a certain location, and free the bit vector.
